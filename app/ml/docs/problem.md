# Quick Serve Kitchens: Shift Planning

**The Challenge**

Monday's schedule looks perfect. Wednesday: three call-offs. Friday: foot traffic doubles because TikTok made your item viral. The schedule is now a dumpster fire. This is QuickServe's weekly reality. The core problem? Accurately predicting and meeting wildly fluctuating customer demand to ensure optimal staffing on every shift. Too few people means terrible service and burnout. Too many means spiraling labor costs. QuickServe needs a Shift Wizard—an intelligent system that monitors schedules, coverage, PTO, surprise events, and constantly recommends the next best move.

**Potential Business Questions**

The following questions are provided to help guide your thinking and inspire potential features for your solution:

- How do we predict demand spikes from social media, weather, or events?
- What's the optimal staffing level for each shift?
- How do we quickly adjust when call-offs happen?
- How can we balance labor costs with service quality?
- How do we incorporate employee preferences while meeting business needs?
